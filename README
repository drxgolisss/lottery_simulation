This repository contains an implementation of classes for managing a set of numbered “balls”, a single lottery game, and a game machine that runs multiple draws.

Building

Make sure you have g++ and make installed. From the project root:
# Build everything
make

# or explicitly:
make program

To clean up build artifacts:
make clean

Running

After a successful build, you will have an executable named program in the project root. Run it with:
./program

By default, the program runs tests for Parts 1–4. Parts 5–7 are commented out in main.cpp—uncomment them as you implement those features.

Sample output is provided in the output file.
